.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Trash-cli package provides a command line interface trashcan utility
compliant with the FreeDesktop.org Trash Specification.
It remembers the name, original path, deletion date, and permissions of
each trashed file.
.br

Files trashed from the home partition will be in either $XDG_DATA_HOME/Trash
or ~/.local/share/Trash/ (if $XDG_DATA_HOME is not defined or empty).

Files trashed from other partitions will be in one of the two places:

 - $top_dir/.Trash/$uid
 - $top_dir/.Trash-$uid

Where:
 - $top_dir is the mount point of the volume containing the file to be removed
 - $uid is the numeric ID of the deleting user

The first option $top_dir/.Trash/$uid works only when .Trash dir has the sticky
bit set. The second option is used when the first is not viable.

.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.TP
Names of files or directories to move to the trash can.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.IP "-f"
.br
Silently ignore any files or directories that do not exist.
Do not print error messages, and do not return a nonzero status
to the caller, because of any such nonexistent arguments.

.IP "-h, --help"
Show help message and exit.

.IP "--trash-dir=TRASHDIR"
Use TRASHDIR as the trash folder.

.IP "-v, --verbose"
Explain what is being done.

.IP "--version"
Show the program's version number and exit.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.nf
$ trash-put foo   # trashes foo 
.fi
