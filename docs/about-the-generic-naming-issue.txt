How the command names changed?
==============================

The earlier versions of trash-cli uses these commands names:
 * trash
 * empty-trash
 * list-trash
 * restore-trash

When the trash-cli project was proposed to Fedora the Red Hat peoples 
complaint about the commmand name 'trash' to be too generic and they refused 
to include the package in Fedora.

The discussion started on [1] and followed in [2].

The the commands names where then renamed from *-trash to trash-* that will 
exploit the shell TAB-completion. This change was suggested by Behdad Esfahbod 
(see [3]) 

After those discussion on the upstream the names of the commands where changed 
to:

 * trash            # trashes files and directories.
 * trash-empty      # empty the trashcan(s).
 * trash-list       # list trashed files.
 * restore-trash    # restore a trashed file.

A summary of all these discussion is available at [4].

After that the packagers lose theirs interest and the trash-cli was not 
packaged.
