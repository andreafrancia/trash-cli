How the command names changed?
==============================

The earlier versions of trash-cli used these command names:
 * trash
 * empty-trash
 * list-trash
 * restore-trash

When the trash-cli project was proposed to Fedora the Red Hat peoples
complaint about the command name 'trash' to be too generic and they refused
to include the package in Fedora.

The discussion started on [1] and followed in [2].

The command names were then renamed from *-trash to trash-* that will
exploit the shell TAB-completion. This change was suggested by Behdad Esfahbod
(see [3])

After those discussion on the upstream the names of the commands were changed
to:

 * trash            # trashes files and directories.
 * trash-empty      # empty the trashcan(s).
 * trash-list       # list trashed files.
 * restore-trash    # restore a trashed file.

A summary of all these discussion is available at [4].

After that the packagers lose their interest and the trash-cli was not
packaged.
