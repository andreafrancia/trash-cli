DELSAFE
=======

URL: http://homepage.esoterica.pt/~nx0yew/delsafe/

Use a different approach to the same problem.  While 'trash' provide a extra
command that put files in the trash, 'delsafe' modifies the semantics of the
existing commands.

Apparently 'delsafe' overrides the library calls of unlink, unlinkat, rename,
open and fopen modifying the semantics of these functions.  A program that was
designed to works with the original functions may not work well with the
overridden functions. For example is the KDE filemanager which as two
commands:
 - delete file
 - trash file

Using 'delsafe' these commands will become:

 - delete file --> trash file in the delsafe trash
 - trash file --> trash file in the KDE trash

I prefer the 'trash' approach because don't change the semantics of the
existing program letting the user chose when putting files in the trash and
when removing them.

Personally I don't like the model where each deletion should recorded
somewhere. 'trash' is intended to be used only in interactive shells, if a
program decides to delete, or trunk a file the information loss risk IMHO
should be managed in the context of this program.

Comments:
 - This program seems not compliant with the FreeDesktopTrashSpecification.
 - It compresses trashed file instead of just moving it.
 - Like trash-cli can trash and restore directories.
 - Seems that the development was ended in 2003.

trash by skymt
==============

URL: http://mysite.verizon.net/skymt/trash/
Language: Python

I reviewed the version [http://mysite.verizon.net/skymt/trash/trash-0.2.tar.gz
0.2]

Is the only other CLI implementation of FreeDesktopTrashSpecification I ever
found till now (2008-06-29)

Features:
 - Operation supported:
  * trash files and directories: yes
  * listing trashed files: no
  * restoring trashed files: no
  * emptying the trashcan: no
 - Support of volumes trashcans: no
 - Can be used as alias='rm': no

Notes:
 - *(Better than trash-cli)* Seems much simpler of trash-cli.\
 - *(Better than trash-cli)* Prints sensible output if the trashcan
   directories permission are wrong.
 - Not object oriented.

Gnome Trashcan

As of Nautilus 2.22, GNOME support the XDG Trash specification through GIO and
the GVFS-Trash backend. You can find the code for this backend here:

    http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/gvfs/trunk/daemon/

and GIO is in GLib:

Safe RM does not talk about Trash Cans. The program alert you whenewer you
attempt to delete files known to be important.

I think it support only trashing files (not trash listing, or restoring).
